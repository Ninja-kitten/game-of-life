Description:
To summarize, when the program is run it should:
1. Ask the user if they wish to start with a random configuration, or specify a flatfile
configuration. Prompt appropriately depending on the response.
2. Ask the user what kind of boundary mode to run in.
3. Ask the user if they want a brief pause between generations, if they want to have
to press the “enter” key, or if they want to output to a file.
4. Carry out the simulation
5. If the simulation is infinite, just keep running. But if the world becomes empty or
stabilizes, the simulation should halt and ask the user to press “enter” to exit the
program.
